                <p>I have 4 months of experience in JavaScript. I did it in Advanced Web Development. It is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.</p><br>
